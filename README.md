# bingo-game
this is a pretty simple NCURSES-based bingo game written in C (mostly for educational purposes on my own part).

The bingo.zip file contains the final distribution of the current build.

To run the game, simply extract the zip file and run bingo.sh.`

## Next steps
* handle the job of the shell script within the C program

* put actual stuff in the wordlist

* add a window at the bottom detailing instructions

* add colors

* better indicators for checked off panels

* free space logic
