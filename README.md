# bingo-game
this is a pretty simple NCURSES-based bingo game written in C (mostly for
educational purposes on my own part).

The bingo.zip file contains the final distribution of the current build.

To run the game, simply extract the zip file and run bingo.sh.`

The wordlist is kind of poking fun at a certain professor, but know that it is
done entirely from a place of love.

## Next steps
* handle the job of the shell script within the C program

* add a window at the bottom detailing instructions

* add colors

* better indicators for checked off panels

* free space logic
